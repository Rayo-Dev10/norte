# Repo Guidelines

- The project uses a modular structure with HTML, CSS and JS files under their respective folders.
- JavaScript modules must use ES module syntax and `'use strict'` at the top.
- There are currently no automated tests. Add them in the future as needed.
- Keep code minimal and clean without frameworks.
